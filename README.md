# 1.2-Exceptions-Level1

## üìÑ Description ‚Äì Exercise Statement

This project contains the solution to the following Java exercise:

### Exercise 1
1. Create a class `Product` with attributes `name` and `price`.
2. Create a class `Sale` with:
   - A collection of products.
   - An attribute `totalPrice`.
   - A method `calculateTotal()`:
     - If the list of products is empty, it must throw a custom exception `EmptySaleException` with the message:
       `"To make a sale you must first add products"`.
     - If there are products, it must calculate and store the total price of all products.
3. Create the custom exception class `EmptySaleException`:
   - It must extend `Exception`.
   - Its constructor must receive the message.
   - When captured, the message is displayed using `getMessage()`.
4. Write the necessary code to **generate and capture** a standard `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.
